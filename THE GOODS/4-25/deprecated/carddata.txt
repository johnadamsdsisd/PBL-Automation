Experiential Inquiry Lessons
Students follow a specific process to apply their prior knowledge to a new situation.  (1) Observe something and describe it. (2) Apply theories or rules to explain observation.  (3) Based on the explanation, make a prediction.  (4) Set up an experiment to test the prediction. (5) Explain results and compare to earlier explanation. Try using Kidblog or Weebly for students to record steps of the inquiry process.

21ST CENTURY SKILL-BUILDING
The learning environment during PBL units inherently develop of 21st century skills, but it is equally important that the 4 C’s are taught explicitly in some classrooms.  The teacher may need to provide examples of communication, collaboration (vs. cooperation),  creativity, and critical thinking.

CRITICAL FRIENDS

Critical Friends is a process by which students get feedback in the form of I likes and I wonders. This is a crucial step in project planning as many of the problems that arise during implementation of projects could be seen during this time.  Student groups may be paired so that they alternate presenting their PBL product and providing feedback to class peers.

LAUNCH

The PBL launch is equivalent to the ‘hook’ or engagement activity of a traditional lesson.  A field trip, video, guest speaker, videoconference etc. is followed by a know/need –to-know charting process.  Students are then grouped and tasked with signing group contracts and identifying student roles for the duration on the PBL unit.

CELEBRATION & REFLECTION    

A strong PBL should end with a celebration for student efforts.  Guests should include community members and professionals who were instrumental in the PBL process and could share student work and solutions to authentic world problems.   This is event should also include a reflection session in which students may share lessons and thoughts from the PBL experience.
